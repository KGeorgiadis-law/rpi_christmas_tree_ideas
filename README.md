Rough scripts for 3D Xmas Tree for Raspberry Pi

tree6.py and tree7.py borrow from the Gpiozero documentation ("Who's home indicator" recipe)[http://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes_advanced.html#who-s-home-indicator]
to light up rows of the tree depending on whether specific devices are connected to a network or how many devices are connected to a network, respectively.
